# 벼락치기

Welcome to ```Lightning Strike```, the chronicle of my caffeine-fueled journey through countless hours of coding during my bachelors as a CS/Business major in UIUC and SNU. “Lightning Strike” or in Korean, "벼락치기" refers to the act of absolute last-minute cramming and coding AKA procrastination which I believe perfectly encapsulates the MOJO of my times. Brace yourself for a delightful and miserable dive into sleepless nights, aha moments, uncompiling code, and an array of triumphs and tribulations as I tackle the world of programming.

I plan to constantly update this REPO for my personal recording purposes or anyone interested in any of the projects. 

HOWEVER Please, please, pretty please do not copy the code if you are a pesky SNU student, as this is repo is meant to document my personal growth not for an cheap way to cheat your courses... 

# UIUC Courses
AKA the prehistoric times when I rarely kept track of my code work and projects. Maybe I took the "Carpe Diem" way too seriously and have given too little thought to the future. I will try to scramble as many interesting projects (if I have even done any) to this folder

+ ECE 210
+ ECE 220
+ and other extracurriculars 

# SNU Courses
When I started to take my work abit more seriously.
+ CS Courses
  + Computing
  + Programming Practice
  + Discrete Mathematics
  + Logic Design
  + Computer Architecture
  + System Programming

+ Other interesting Projects
